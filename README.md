# Student_Exam_performance_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_AWS

This project focuses on predicting a student’s exam performance using machine learning techniques based on demographic, 
academic, and behavioral factors. The goal is to analyze patterns in student data and build a predictive model that estimates 
performance accurately.

# Project Overview
Educational institutions often require insights into student performance to provide timely support and improve outcomes. This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict student exam scores by analyzing factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation, and previous scores.

The project covers the complete ML lifecycle:
Data analysis and visualization
Feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
Deployment using a Flask web application
